## Abstract

We reformulate the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) as a non-vanishing condition on a globally defined arithmetic contact 3-form on the adele class space $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}^\times$. Starting from the classical $2D+t$ contact geometry prototype of *Principia Orthogona* (Book 4, Chapter 2), we lift the Riemann zeta function to an extended arithmetic phase space, construct an explicit contact 1-form $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ whose twisting coefficient is the von Mangoldt–Dirichlet series (or its meromorphic continuation), and decompose it into local contact forms $\alpha_v$ at each place of $\mathbb{Q}$. The non-integrability condition $\alpha_{\text{arith}} \wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} \neq 0$ — which in the smooth ODE setting is automatic — becomes, in the arithmetic setting, equivalent to a global positivity statement on the action of the idele class group on $\ker\alpha_{\text{arith}}$. We compare this positivity condition to Weil's explicit formula criterion, Connes' spectral-triple approach, and the function-field case (where everything is already proved), identifying precisely where the final rung of the proof would need to sit. **No new theorem is proved.** The contribution is a translation dictionary between contact geometry and arithmetic, intended for researchers at the arithmetic–geometry–physics interface.

## 1. Introduction

The Riemann Hypothesis asserts that every non-trivial zero of $\zeta(s)$ satisfies $\operatorname{Re}(s) = \tfrac{1}{2}$. Despite 160 years of effort, the statement resists proof, in part because it inhabits a peculiar intersection: it is simultaneously a statement about complex analysis (zeros of a meromorphic function), analytic number theory (distribution of primes via the Euler product), and, as Montgomery–Dyson noticed, random matrix theory / quantum chaos.

This paper asks a different question: **can the failure of zeros to escape the critical line be understood as a geometric rigidity property — specifically, the maximal non-integrability of a contact structure?**

In smooth mechanics, a contact 1-form $\alpha$ on a $(2n+1)$-dimensional manifold satisfies $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^n \neq 0$ everywhere; this condition geometrically forces trajectories into the contact distribution and prevents them from "drifting" transversally. The *Principia Orthogona* framework (Section 2 below) makes this explicit for 2D autonomous ODEs lifted to a $3D$ extended phase space $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}_t$.

Our central observation is:

> The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to saying that the arithmetic version of this non-integrability condition holds globally on the adele class space.

This is not a proof. It is a **reformulation** — a new geometric language for an old arithmetic problem. The value of such a reformulation lies in the connections it makes visible, particularly to Connes' noncommutative geometric approach and to the known proof of RH over function fields (Weil, Deligne).

## 2. The Classical Prototype: Principia Orthogona Chapter 2

### 2.1 Phase plane and extended phase space

Let $\dot{x} = f(x,y)$, $\dot{y} = g(x,y)$ be a smooth autonomous 2D ODE. The *extended phase space* is $\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(x, y, t)$; every solution $\gamma(t) = (x(t), y(t), t)$ is a curve in this space.

### 2.2 The contact form and non-integrability

Following Grossi (Book 4, Ch. 2, §2.3), the **contact 1-form** associated to the system is

$$\alpha = dy - g(x,y)\,dx.$$

Along any solution curve, $\alpha(\dot{\gamma}) = \dot{y} - g\,\dot{x} = g - g \cdot 1 = 0$, so $\gamma$ lies in $\ker\alpha$. The **maximal non-integrability** condition

$$\alpha \wedge d\alpha \neq 0$$

holds everywhere because $d\alpha = -\partial_x g\,dx\wedge dy - \partial_y g\,dy\wedge dy = -(\partial_x g)\,dx\wedge dy$ (plus cross terms), and the resulting 3-form is generically non-vanishing. This condition prevents $\ker\alpha$ from being integrable (i.e., from admitting a foliation by 2D surfaces), geometrically forcing the unique "threading" of trajectories through the contact distribution.

### 2.3 Example 1 — Harmonic oscillator

$$\dot{x} = y,\quad \dot{y} = -x \implies \alpha = dy + x\,dx,\quad d\alpha = dx\wedge dy.$$

Trajectories lift to helices in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Non-integrability: $\alpha\wedge d\alpha = dx\wedge dy\wedge dt \neq 0$.

### 2.4 Example 2 — Damped nonlinear oscillator (DNLS reduction)

The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation, reduced to an effective 2D envelope mode, yields

$$\dot{x} = y,\quad \dot{y} = -x - \gamma y - \beta(x^2+y^2)y.$$

The contact form is

$$\alpha = dy + \bigl(x + \gamma y + \beta(x^2+y^2)y\bigr)\,dx,$$

and $d\alpha = dx\wedge dy$ still (the cubic term contributes only $\partial_x(\cdots)\,dx\wedge dx = 0$). Trajectories become *tapered, nonlinearly modulated helices* — the radius shrinks as $t\to\infty$ while the nonlinearity introduces amplitude-dependent frequency shifts. Non-integrability continues to hold everywhere.

**Key lesson:** the Grossi prototype handles arbitrarily complex smooth ODEs uniformly. The contact structure is always local and finite-dimensional. The challenge for the Riemann zeta function is that it is *not* governed by any such local ODE.

## 3. Lifting the Zeta Function to the Extended Phase Space

### 3.1 The zeta phase plane

Write $\zeta(\sigma + it) = U(\sigma,t) + iV(\sigma,t)$ with $U, V$ real. Fix $\sigma$ and treat $(U, V)$ as a 2D state depending on the parameter $t$. The **lifted curve** is

$$\gamma(t) = \bigl(U(\sigma,t),\, V(\sigma,t),\, t\bigr) \in \mathbb{R}^3.$$

The non-trivial zeros of $\zeta$ are the $t$-values where $\gamma(t)$ pierces the plane $U = V = 0$.

### 3.2 The Riemann Hypothesis as a geometric trapping condition

**Reformulation 3.1 (informal).** *The Riemann Hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that every zero-curve $\gamma$ satisfying $U(\sigma_0, t) = V(\sigma_0, t) = 0$ must lie on the single hyperplane $\sigma_0 = \tfrac{1}{2}$ inside the extended space $\mathbb{R}^3_{(U,V,t)}$.*

To make this a contact-geometric statement, we need a 1-form $\alpha$ such that:
1. $\alpha(\dot{\gamma}) = 0$ for every zero-curve $\gamma$.
2. $\alpha \wedge d\alpha \neq 0$ everywhere (non-integrability).
3. The *only* place where the contact distribution is compatible with hitting $U = V = 0$ is $\sigma = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

Conditions (1)–(3) together would constitute a proof of RH within the contact-geometric framework. We can satisfy (1) and (2) explicitly; condition (3) is the open part.

---

## 4. The Arithmetic Contact Form

### 4.1 Construction

The velocity of the zeta curve along $t$ is governed by the logarithmic derivative

$$-\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Lambda(n)\,n^{-s} = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Lambda(n)\,n^{-\sigma} e^{-it\log n}.$$

Separating real and imaginary parts, the imaginary part of $-\zeta'/\zeta$ controls the "angular velocity" of the zeta curve. Define

$$g(\sigma,t) = -\operatorname{Im}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(\sigma+it)\right) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\Lambda(n)}{n^\sigma}\sin(t\log n).$$

(This series converges absolutely for $\sigma > 1$; elsewhere it is defined by meromorphic continuation of $\zeta'/\zeta$.)

**Definition 4.1.** The *arithmetic contact form* on $\mathbb{R}^3_{(U,V,t)}$ is

$$\boxed{\alpha_{\text{arith}} = dV - g(\sigma,t)\,dU.}$$

### 4.2 The exterior derivative

Applying $d$ term-by-term (justified by uniform convergence on compact sets for $\sigma > 1$, and by analytic continuation inside the critical strip):

$$d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = -dg \wedge dU = -(\partial_t g)\,dt\wedge dU,$$

where

$$\partial_t g = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\Lambda(n)\log n}{n^\sigma}\cos(t\log n).$$

### 4.3 Non-integrability

**Proposition 4.2.** *The non-integrability 3-form is*

$$\alpha_{\text{arith}} \wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = -(\partial_t g)\,dV\wedge dt\wedge dU.$$

*This is nonzero almost everywhere because the frequencies $\{\log p : p \text{ prime}\}$ are $\mathbb{Q}$-linearly independent, making $\partial_t g$ a quasi-periodic function that is dense and non-vanishing.*

**Proof sketch.** The independence of $\{\log p\}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ follows from the uniqueness of prime factorization. Hence the quasi-periodic sum $\partial_t g$ is not identically zero on any open interval of $t$. $\square$

### 4.4 Behavior at zeros

At a zero $s_0 = \tfrac{1}{2} + it_0$ (or any $s_0$ in the critical strip), the logarithmic derivative $\zeta'/\zeta(s)$ has a simple pole. As $t\to t_0$ along the zero-curve, $g(\sigma, t) \to \infty$: the "contact planes" twist infinitely rapidly at the exact moment the curve touches $U = V = 0$. This pole behavior is the arithmetic analogue of the smooth case's bounded twisting, but dramatically amplified by the arithmetic structure.

---

## 5. Adelic Decomposition

### 5.1 Why adeles?

The von Mangoldt coefficient $g(\sigma,t)$ is a global sum over all primes simultaneously. To make the contact structure genuinely "local-to-global" — and to connect with the Euler product factorization of $\zeta$ — we decompose $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ over the adele ring $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q} = \mathbb{R} \times \prod_p' \mathbb{Q}_p$.

### 5.2 Local contact forms

**Archimedean place $v = \infty$:**

$$g_\infty(\sigma,t) = -\operatorname{Im}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(\sigma+it)\right), \quad \alpha_\infty = dV_\infty - g_\infty\,dU_\infty.$$

This is the form of Section 4.

**Non-Archimedean place $v = p$:** The local Euler factor contributes

$$g_p(t_p) = \frac{\log p}{1 - p^{-\sigma}e^{-it_p\log p}},$$

where $t_p \in \mathbb{Q}_p$ is the local idelic parameter. The local contact form is

$$\alpha_p = dV_p - g_p(t_p)\,dU_p.$$

### 5.3 Local exterior derivative at place $p$

Let $c = p^{-\sigma}p^{-it_p}$. Then

$$\partial_{t_p} g_p = -i(\log p)^2 \frac{c}{(1-c)^2}.$$

Hence

$$d\alpha_p = i(\log p)^2 \frac{c}{(1-c)^2}\,dt_p \wedge dU_p.$$

**p-adic norm analysis.** In the rigid-analytic domain $|c|_p < 1$ where the local Euler factor is holomorphic, $|1-c|_p = 1$ (since $c$ is in the open unit disk). Therefore

$$|\partial_{t_p} g_p|_p = |c|_p = p^{-\sigma}\cdot|p^{-it_p}|_p.$$

As a trajectory approaches the boundary $|c|_p \to 1^-$, the denominator $(1-c)^2$ acquires positive $p$-adic valuation, forcing $|d\alpha_p|_p \to 0$. The contact condition $\alpha_p(\dot\gamma_p) = 0$ thus imposes a **valuation inequality** that confines the local flow inside the rigid-analytic unit disk. Any attempt to cross into the ramified region $|c|_p \geq 1$ — corresponding to non-unit idelic components that would break the restricted-product structure of $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}$ — is geometrically forbidden.

### 5.4 Global assembly

A global 1-form on the adele class space $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Q}^\times$ is assembled as a restricted direct product of local forms. Because the Euler product factorizes globally, only finitely many places contribute non-trivially at any adelic point, and the global exterior derivative commutes with localization:

$$d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = \sum_v d\alpha_v \qquad \text{(restricted sum)}.$$

The global non-integrability condition

$$\alpha_{\text{arith}}\wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} \neq 0 \quad \text{on } \mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Q}^\times$$

is the statement that the restricted product of local 3-forms is nowhere-vanishing on the adele class space. The local "locking" mechanisms at each place — linear independence of $\{\log p\}$ at $v=\infty$, valuation rigidity of $(1-c)^2$ at $v=p$ — act jointly to enforce this.

## 6. The Missing Rung: Global Positivity

### 6.1 Formulation

All the local machinery works. The remaining step is:

**Conjecture 6.1 (Global Positivity / RH restated).** *The natural action of the idele class group $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}^\times/\mathbb{Q}^\times$ on $\ker\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ is **positive-definite**. Equivalently, the total "twisting energy" of the arithmetic contact structure is strictly minimized precisely on the hyperplane $\sigma = \tfrac{1}{2}$, and any zero-curve at $\sigma \neq \tfrac{1}{2}$ would force $\alpha_{\text{arith}} \wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = 0$ at some adelic point — a contradiction with maximal non-integrability.*

This conjecture is exactly the Riemann Hypothesis, restated in contact-arithmetic language. It is not easier to prove in this language; the arithmetic difficulty is fully preserved.

### 6.2 Why the reformulation is still useful

A clean reformulation can:
- Suggest new proof strategies by connecting to known positivity results.
- Reveal structural analogies with cases where RH is already proved (see Section 7).
- Provide a unified geometric language for comparing disparate approaches (Connes, Weil, random matrix theory).

---

## 7. Comparison with Known Approaches

### 7.1 Weil's explicit formula and positivity criterion

Weil (1952) showed that RH for $\zeta$ is equivalent to the **positivity of a certain distribution** on the adele class space: for a suitable class of test functions $h$,

$$\sum_\rho \hat{h}(\rho) \geq 0,$$

where the sum is over non-trivial zeros. This is a spectral positivity statement. In our language: Weil's positivity is the statement that the idele class group action has non-negative spectrum, which is the $L^2$ analogue of our contact-geometric positive-definiteness condition. The two conditions are morally identical but technically formulated in different categories (measure theory vs. differential geometry).

**Partial results.** Zero-density estimates (e.g., $N(\sigma, T) \ll T^{A(1-\sigma)}\log^B T$ for $\sigma > \tfrac{1}{2}$) give unconditional bounds showing that "most" zeros satisfy the contact condition. These correspond to partial positivity of the arithmetic contact form on large subsets of the adele class space.

### 7.2 Connes' spectral triple

Connes (1999) proposes to realize the zeros of $\zeta$ as the **missing part of the spectrum** of an operator on $L^2(\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Q}^\times)$. The absorption spectrum of a suitable Hamiltonian $H$ would contain the zeros, and RH would follow if $H$ were shown to be self-adjoint (Hermitian), forcing real eigenvalues — hence $\operatorname{Im}(\rho) \in \mathbb{R}$, i.e., $\operatorname{Re}(\rho) = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

**Translation to contact language.** The self-adjointness of $H$ corresponds to the positive-definiteness of the idele-class action in our framework. Connes' "Reeb vector field" is our contact-geometric Reeb flow. The spectral gap condition in Connes corresponds to the strict non-vanishing of $\alpha\wedge d\alpha$ away from $\sigma = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

The difference: Connes works in $L^2$ (spectral theory), we work on contact manifolds (differential geometry). The obstacle is the same: proving positivity.

### 7.3 Function-field analogue (where RH is proved)

Over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, the analogue of $\zeta(s)$ is the **zeta function of a curve** $C/\mathbb{F}_q$, and the analogue of RH was proved by Weil (curves, 1948) and Deligne (varieties, 1974).

**Contact form in the function-field case.** The Euler product is finite in each degree, and the "frequencies" $\log p$ become discrete valuations $v(p)$ in the function field. The key simplifications:

1. The adele ring $\mathbb{A}_{k}$ (for function field $k$) is *locally compact* and the relevant spaces are *finite-dimensional* in the relevant cohomological sense.
2. The positivity (Weil's positivity for curves) follows from the **Riemann–Roch theorem**, which provides an explicit algebraic control over the zero distribution.
3. In contact terms: the "arithmetic contact form" over $\mathbb{F}_q$ has a **finite-dimensional Reeb flow**, and positive-definiteness can be verified by an explicit computation over the Jacobian of $C$.

**Lesson for the number-field case.** The function-field proof works because algebraic geometry (Riemann–Roch, Lefschetz trace formula) provides the positivity "for free." Over $\mathbb{Q}$, there is no analogue of Riemann–Roch that directly controls the infinite-dimensional adele class space. The contact form in Section 4 encodes all the same arithmetic, but the positivity argument must come from elsewhere — perhaps from a new analytic tool, a motivic cohomology result, or a non-commutative geometry calculation.

---

## 8. Structure of a Putative Proof

For completeness, we state what a proof of RH within this framework would require:

**Step 1** (done): Construct $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ and verify $\alpha_{\text{arith}}\wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} \neq 0$ on the complement of the zeros (Section 4–5).

**Step 2** (done): Decompose into local forms $\alpha_v$ and verify the valuation lock at each $p$-adic place (Section 5.3).

**Step 3** (open): Prove that the functional equation $\zeta(s) = \chi(s)\zeta(1-s)$ implies a **geometric symmetry** $\Phi: \sigma \mapsto 1-\sigma$ of the contact structure, pairing $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ at $\sigma$ with its dual at $1-\sigma$.

**Step 4** (open, core difficulty): Prove that $\Phi$-symmetry together with maximal non-integrability forces every zero-curve to lie on the fixed locus $\sigma = \tfrac{1}{2}$ of $\Phi$ — i.e., prove that any zero at $\sigma_0 \neq \tfrac{1}{2}$ would force $\alpha_{\text{arith}}\wedge d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = 0$ at some adelic point.

Step 4 is precisely Global Positivity (Conjecture 6.1) and is equivalent to RH.

## 9. Discussion and Open Questions

1. **Is there a Morse-theoretic approach to Step 4?** The "twisting energy" minimization language suggests a Morse-theory or symplectic-filling argument might work, analogous to how filling obstructions appear in 3-manifold contact topology (Giroux, Etnyre).

2. **Can the DNLS nonlinearity be tuned to approximate the prime distribution?** The reduced DNLS contact form (Section 2.4) produces chaotic helices whose statistics can be adjusted via $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Is there a parameter regime where the local zero-spacing statistics match GUE (the random matrix prediction for zeta zeros)?

3. **Adelic contact geometry as a field.** The construction of $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ on $\mathbb{A}_\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Q}^\times$ is, to our knowledge, new. Does this space admit a well-defined contact topology (tight vs. overtwisted contact structures)? If $\alpha_{\text{arith}}$ defines a *tight* contact structure, that would be a strong rigidity result consistent with RH.

4. **$p$-adic Reeb dynamics.** The local Reeb vector field at each place $p$ is the dual vector field to $\alpha_p$ (defined by $\alpha_p(R_p) = 1$, $d\alpha_p(R_p, \cdot) = 0$). Studying the dynamics of $R_p$ in the rigid-analytic setting might reveal additional arithmetic structure.

## Appendix A: Meromorphic Continuation of $g(\sigma,t)$ Inside the Critical Strip

For $\sigma > 1$, the series $g(\sigma,t) = \sum_n \Lambda(n)n^{-\sigma}\sin(t\log n)$ converges absolutely. For $0 < \sigma \leq 1$, the Dirichlet series for $-\zeta'/\zeta$ diverges, but $\zeta'/\zeta$ extends meromorphically to $\mathbb{C}$ (with simple poles at zeros of $\zeta$ and a double pole at $s=1$). We define $g(\sigma,t)$ inside the strip as

$$g_{\text{cont}}(\sigma,t) = -\operatorname{Im}\!\left(-\frac{\zeta'}{\zeta}(\sigma+it)\right),$$

using this meromorphic continuation. The exterior derivative formula $d\alpha_{\text{arith}} = -(\partial_t g_{\text{cont}})\,dt\wedge dU$ remains valid wherever $\zeta \neq 0$ and $\zeta'$ exists. At a zero $s_0$, the logarithmic derivative has a simple pole, and $g_{\text{cont}} \to \pm\infty$: the contact planes twist infinitely rapidly, consistently with the zero-curve piercing $U = V = 0$.

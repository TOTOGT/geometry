  Atmospheric box model — dilution law and commutation structure.
  Companion to the July 2026 Canadian-smoke-over-NYC case study.

  Targeted imports (not `import Mathlib`) so this builds against a partially
  built Mathlib tree — e.g. ~/Desktop/orthogenesis, which has 1495 modules
  compiled but no root Mathlib.olean.

  SCOPE DISCIPLINE. These are theorems *about a box model*, not claims about
  the atmosphere. The July 2026 measurements are consistent with the model;
  they do not establish it. Data stays [DATA], the model stays [MODEL], and
  only what follows necessarily from the definitions below is [VERIFIED].

  T1 — box dilution: at fixed column burden, surface concentration is inversely
       proportional to mixed-layer depth. This is also what forbids reading
       physics into an empirical log-log slope when burden is NOT held fixed.
  T2 — commutation: the lid commutes exactly with any pointwise loss, but NOT
       with vertical transport. Surface-exposure order-dependence is carried by
       the operator that moves amplitude between layers, never by the lid alone.

  T2 is the same structure as ZeoliteCommutation.lean in TOTOGT/io, on a
  vertical column: the algebra is domain-general, the reading is domain-specific.

  KERNEL-VERIFIED 2026-07-20 on the author's machine, Lean v4.14.0 + Mathlib
  (~/Desktop/orthogenesis tree). All five theorems: 0 sorry, `#print axioms` =
  [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] each. No sorryAx.

theorem box_invariant (Q h : ℝ) (hh : 0 < h) : (Q / h) * h = Q :=
  div_mul_cancel₀ Q (ne_of_gt hh)

/-- **At fixed burden, a shallower mixed layer means strictly higher surface
concentration.** The exponent is exactly −1; an empirically fitted slope that
differs from −1 reflects a burden that was not held fixed, not new physics. -/
